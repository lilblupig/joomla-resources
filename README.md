# **Joomla Resource Manager!**

# Overview

Based on the first ten sections of the tutorial [Developing an MVC Component](https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Developing_an_MVC_Component/).  This component will allow a Joomla admin user with appropriate authority to create and maintain a library of resources.  The next step is to create a way to output this information in a way other than using a menu item, such as a module.
